Project Spec ‚Äì Backstage India (Frontend-First)
üìå Project Summary
Build a web-based casting platform for India where:

Actors can discover and apply to casting calls with portfolios.

Producers can post casting calls, define roles, and view applicants.

You will first complete the entire frontend using dummy data, with full UI/UX flows, and later plug in backend functionality.

üé® Design & UX Guidelines
Use Tailwind CSS with ShadCN UI for clean and responsive components

Keep UI professional but minimal

Use clear role-based layouts (Actor vs Producer)

Use toasts for action confirmations (e.g. ‚ÄúApplication Submitted‚Äù)

üîç Filters on Audition Listing Page
Role Gender

Age Range

Category (TV, Film, Ad)

Location

Keywords (Search bar)

üíæ Frontend Tech Stack
Next.js (App Router)

Tailwind CSS

Typescript

React Context (or Zustand) for simple role/session state

Dummy data hardcoded into component or local file (JSON/JS object)

üß© Frontend Logic (with Dummy Data)
All interactions are local:

Submitting forms shows a toast and adds to in-memory state

Audition list reads from static array

No backend/API calls

üì¶ Future Backend (v2) [Optional]
(Not needed now but documented for later)

Use Supabase or Firebase to:

Store users, auditions, applications

Upload media (images, resumes, videos)

Authentication via email/password or OTP

Admin moderation panel

‚úÖ MVP Completion Criteria (Frontend)
Fully functional UI for both Actor and Producer

Navigation and conditional routing based on role

Forms and submission simulated with dummy data

No hard errors, all actions visually confirmed
